### Update on 2023

Files for all periodic elements were added including the main properties of each one. Notice that there might be mistakes. All the data was obtained as mentioned on the table from [GoodmanSciences (Gist)](https://gist.github.com/GoodmanSciences/c2dd862cd38f21b0ad36b8f96b4bf1ee) on a csv file including all the data.
